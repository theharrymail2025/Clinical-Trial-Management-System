# Decentralized Waste Management and Recycling System

A blockchain-based solution for efficient waste management, recycling incentivization, and promotion of circular economy principles.

## Overview

This system leverages smart contracts to create a transparent, efficient, and incentive-driven waste management ecosystem. It connects waste generators, collectors, recyclers, and material buyers in a decentralized network while optimizing resources and promoting sustainable practices.

## Core Components

### Waste Tracking Contract

The waste tracking contract serves as the foundation of the system, providing:

- Real-time monitoring of waste generation and disposal
- Digital waste manifests with cryptographic proof
- Automated compliance reporting
- Historical waste data analytics
- Integration with IoT sensors for accurate measurements

### Recycling Incentive Contract

This contract implements a token-based reward system to encourage proper waste management:

- Token rewards for verified waste sorting and recycling
- Reputation scoring for participants
- Tiered reward structure based on waste type and quality
- Smart bin integration for automated sorting verification
- Token redemption marketplace for sustainable products

### Collection Route Optimization Contract

Optimizes waste collection operations through:

- Dynamic route planning based on real-time bin fill levels
- Fuel-efficient path calculations
- Load balancing across collection vehicles
- Emergency collection request handling
- Performance analytics and reporting

### Circular Economy Contract

Facilitates the creation of a marketplace for recycled materials:

- Real-time material pricing and availability
- Quality verification and certification
- Smart contract-based trading
- Automated payment processing
- Supply chain tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Node.js v16.x or higher
- Hardhat development environment

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/waste-management-system

# Install dependencies
cd waste-management-system
npm install

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Set your blockchain network configurations
3. Configure IoT device integration parameters
4. Set up reward token parameters

## Usage

### For Waste Generators

```javascript
// Register waste generation
await wasteTrackingContract.registerWaste(wasteType, quantity);

// Request collection
await collectionContract.requestPickup(location, wasteType);
```

### For Collectors

```javascript
// View optimized routes
const todayRoutes = await routeOptimizationContract.getOptimizedRoutes();

// Confirm collection
await wasteTrackingContract.confirmCollection(wasteId, quantity);
```

### For Recyclers

```javascript
// Register processed materials
await circularEconomyContract.registerMaterial(materialType, quantity, quality);

// List materials for sale
await circularEconomyContract.listMaterial(materialId, price, quantity);
```
